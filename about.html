      <h3>Hello my name is Iza (pronounced like eza,but way better).<br> I believe in creating—<br>creating a story,  an experience , and awesome solutions to help people  perceive the world.</h3>
      <p>Yes designs should be beautiful but far more than that, design  should have a purpose, a meaning—an action! There's always something to learn,  and there's always a solution to everything, limited only by how far you're willing  to stretch the imagination.</p>
      <p>I design things—websites, Illustration and prints  and animation. Design is what I do, but the thought behind the design,  the communication aspect,  and how the user understands the design, is the  reason I do it!.</p>
      <p>  I’m way too curious and I enjoy finding the most elegant ways to harmonize content with form. That’s a fancy way of saying I take text and colours and images and I arrange them in a way that immediately makes it usable for the user.</p>
      <p>So, let's stretch some brains and be extraordinary. You in?</p>
      <p>Email me and let's get talking.</p>
