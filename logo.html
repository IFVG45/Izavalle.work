            <strong class="normal">Branding guideline</strong> Establishing a brand

Branding guideline for a small authentic tea place, done as an exercise. I wrote the copy, designed the logo and branding, and created the book layout. The book is written in non jargon with short explanations around topics that I felt might need a bit more information rather than just giving a small paragraph at the client. These ares include social media use, photography, logo use and more.

The concept or design and layout

Initial inspirations and influences were found in earthy, tactile and homemade textures: weathered old and handmade products. I envisioned the antique tea place equipment and century old traditional tea places that represented the strong family ties of tradition and background history.

During the sketching and concept-development stages,hand made typefaces were explored for the word mark. Logo sketches featured the half of the maple leaf. Attention was paid to ensure the elements represented a rustic, traditional, home-grown roots vibe that would best suit the brand.

The Solution

As the logo took shape and we began testing it in different locations, we realized that the maple leaf illustration was a touch too unwieldy to be used in small sizes or single-color prints. So we opted instead to use the half of the maple leaf as more of a markâ€”it graces illustrations throughout the site or any print items without being directly attached to the logo. Win-win. Ditching Creative from the word mark, opting to use it only in formal listings.
As well as creating my own hand lettering to give it that flatter but yet homemade look and sense that the tea place wanted to potrait.
