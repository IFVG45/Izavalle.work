        <h3 class="unit title">The Maple Valley Branding</h3>
        <p class="unit description">Branding guideline for a small authentic tea place, done as an exercise. I wrote the copy, designed the logo and branding, and created the book layout. The book is written in non jargon with short explanations around topics that I felt might need a bit more information rather than just giving a small paragraph at the client. These ares include social media use, photography, logo use and more.</p>
        <h4>The concept or design and layout </h4>
       <p>Initial inspirations and influences were found in earthy, tactile and homemade textures: weathered old and handmade products. I envisioned the antique tea place equipment and century old traditional tea places that represented the strong family ties of tradition and background history.
       During the sketching and concept-development stages,hand made typefaces were explored for the word mark. Logo sketches featured the half of the maple leaf. Attention was paid to ensure the elements represented a rustic, traditional, home-grown roots vibe that would best suit the brand.
