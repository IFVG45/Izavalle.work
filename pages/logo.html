          <p>Objective:Branding guideline for a small authentic tea place, done as an exercise. I wrote the copy, designed the logo and branding, and created the book layout. The book is written in non jargon with short explanations around topics that I felt might need a bit more information rather than just giving a small paragraph at the client.
             These ares include social media use, photography, logo use and more..</p>

          <img class="work-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/../images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Concept: The concept is targeting people who love to eat and drink tea .This offers so much more to the customer. </p>

          <img class="work-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/../images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Solution: As the logo took shape and we began testing it in different locations, we realized that the maple leaf illustration was a touch too unwieldy to be used in small sizes or single-color prints. So we opted instead to use the half of the maple leaf as more of a markâ€”it graces illustrations throughout the site or any print items without being directly attached to the logo. Win-win. Ditching Creative from the word mark, opting to use it only in formal listings.
As well as creating my own hand lettering to give it that flatter but yet homemade look and sense that the tea place wanted to potrait</p>
