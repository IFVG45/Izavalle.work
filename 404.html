          Well, this is awkward. The page you've tried to access doesn't exist.
          At least some of the other pages have some pretty pictures to look at.

          Try clicking below to get home</p>
         <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/"><img class="homebtn pad-b-2" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/design/homebutton.svg" alt="home button"></a>
