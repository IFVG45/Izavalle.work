                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">This is an editorial layout of an article that is about Audrey Hepburn. The article describes how Audrey is a fashion icon, and she shouldnâ€™t be used in a commercial for the Gap. My aim was to keep the article in the high fashion theme. I mixed modern and cursive fonts, and kept a strong layout with ample whitespace. I kept the colours black and white for high contrast, and used a pop of a dark purple.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">This was a newsletter article for a rockie horse / kids toys magazine. I kept the design here bright and fresh with colours that appealed to the target audience and fit the tone of the article. The fonts were a mid of a serif for the body, and a sans serif font for the accented text.</p>
