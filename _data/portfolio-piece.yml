- title: Canadian Pacific Railway
  description: <p>I worked with <a href="http://sparkadvocacy.ca/">spark* advocacy</a> and <a href="http://www.cpr.ca/en">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> on this unique campaign.<p>Canada’s existence as a nation depended on the construction of rail lines to link BC to eastern Canada. Following the lead of the 1967 Confederation Train, it is fitting that CP’s Community Train Tour should traverse the country to remind Canadians of this historic fact, and how the railway has connected Canada and Canadians for 135 years.<p>CP ran the ‘Spirit of Tomorrow’ train from Vancouver, BC to Ottawa, ON between July 28th and August 20th 2017, making 11 other stops in communities along the way. Each stop featured CP’s unique heritage cars and diesel locomotive, a free concert by Dean Brody with an opening First Nations act, and free activities on the ground.

Of that number, more than 800 end up in the NICU.<p>Michael Potter, Ottawa’s well-known philanthropist and high-tech icon, hosted a memorable fundraiser for The Ottawa Hospital’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the General Hospital.<p>I worked with <a href="http://sparkadvocacy.ca/">spark* advocacy</a> to create a brand with event collateral for The Twinkle Twinkle Future Stars Gala. The event raised over $3-million, with more than 200 guests present. The evening’s entertainment included acts from Serena Ryder, Alan Doyle, and Randy Bachman, and This Hour Has 22 Minutes comedian and writer Mark Critch.

#   description: Tiffany & Co. is best known for their diamond jewelry. After researching the diamond mineral and the strong bonding between its atoms, I chose to demonstrate the comparable relationship between in-love couples, and what the engagement ring represented. The rock collection illustrates the pathway a couple travels together, and the milestones collected on the way.<p>Found under each rock is a location where the in-love couple has travelled. The label is placed under the logo throughout, bringing a sense of consistency to the campaign. The Tiffany Blue colour is also incorporated in each ad, making the brand easily identifiable.<p>The locations used for each label can be found in the US, where the Tiffany’s headquarters is also situated, linking the concept and brand inherently.

# - title: A Clockwork Orange Book Cover Redesign
#   description: A dystopian novella written by Anthony Burgess in 1962, with the central conceit being about an aggressive new form of aversion therapy that is being used to reform criminals. Called the Ludovico method, it relies on a cocktail of drugs, a barrage of images, and classical music to elicit the desired Pavlovian responses from criminals. <p>I created a script typeface out of modeling clay that resembles brain mass, with bits of wire and toothpicks embedded. This was meant to invoke the Ludovico method scenes, where toothpicks were used to keep Alex’s eyes open, and the wires of the machines were hooked into his body. <p>The book was written to address conservative older people’s claims that the ‘current generation’ was worse than any other. Burgess believed that violence and the morally reprehensible behavior that youth exhibited were another manifestation of ‘the folly of youth’, and that given time and space, they would simply grow out of it. The type is the dominant feature by default. On an otherwise blank page, the only artistic and design choices present are in the mass of brain and wire used to spell out the title.
