                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">This project was to create an infographics. I chosen to do it for Identity thief, and decided to create a poster with a bit of a twist. I wanted the poster to represent the feeling trapped and sad, yet stand out from what you would normally picture in your mind. I chose to use the iconic look of a credit card , and have it feel serious but yet create the concern. The poster was created using Adobe Photoshop and Indesign.</p>

                <p class="pjt-info gutter pad-b">WINNER is an all-natural fashion clothing store, adding different types of popular brands at the lowest price. The goal was to create a cohesive ad campaign that that appeals to their young adult target audience. My concept was to reach out to the audience by getting involved through how they interactive with their daily routines. The tagline ‘Stroll with Style’ encourages consumers to get involved
                    and image themselves strolling around the park or the office with this awesome and affordable clothes. Each campaign piece showcases a young woman adult with different types of clothes for all the seasons.Showing variaty.
                    This project began with a concept, I then sketched out different layouts and played around with colour to match each frame. I created the project using photography, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Adobe InDesign.</p>
